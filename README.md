# Dictionary
Python(Thonny): I created a Python dictionary search program that lets users look up computer-related terms. It stores terms as keys and definitions as values. User input is converted to uppercase for case-insensitivity. Using a loop, it checks if the term exists showing the definition if found, or "Not found" if not.
